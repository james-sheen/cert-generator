"""The README is the one surface that can promise what no index can deliver.

`bmc-sensor-audit` already carries a pair like this -- its README and its CITATION
file each have to agree with the released state -- but both are anchored on a
version sentinel, `__version__ == "0.0.0"`. That does not transplant here. This
package declares a real `0.1.0` and is on no index, so the sentinel reads
*released*, the check passes, and the README goes on sending readers to a name
PyPI answers 404 for. A mechanism copied without its premise is a check that runs
correctly and asks the wrong question.

What the README can be held to is agreeing with itself: a page that says this is
unreleased must not also hand a reader a command that only works once it is. The
version that appears in `odm-qa-pipeline`'s pin manifest for gate 4 is the same
git direct reference the block at the top of the README now shows, so the two
records of *where this comes from* say one thing.
